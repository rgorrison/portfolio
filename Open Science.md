# Open Science (Orrison, 2024)

Science is fundamentally a team sport and my graduate research exemplifies this well.
This dissertation has been made possible through the open and collaborative efforts of scientists
from all over the world. The paleoclimate archives which I have leverage for their critical
information about the past and present climate have been made possible by geologists and others
in the field in South America, many of whom belong to South American institutions. The
publications and incredible place-based knowledge of these colleagues have shaped a strong
foundation upon which my work explores paleoclimate from a synthesis-based perspective.
However, the geographic and financial challenges within the global science community restrict
access for many South American colleagues on a number of levels: limited distribution of their
own research findings, need for expanding research sovereignty initiatives, limited access to for-
profit journals, rare travel for conferences, and the lack of access to state-of-the art equipment.
While not every group or individual faces these issues, my personal experience has brought me
into contact with examples of each scenario listed above and shed light for me onto the
sometimes harsh inequalities of the project of science.

The resulting philosophy I have developed is one of Open Science; where dissemination
of research findings and methodologies are critical not only for the advancement of science but
the continued progress toward democratic science as a practice. To this end, my research has
been published in open-access journals or will be published as open-access articles and the code
I have used has been published in the public Zenodo archive with a digital object identifier (doi).
I have navigated successful remote collaborations and am proud to have a broad co-authorship
176network that includes international colleagues. I have developed a small guide for the publication
of code on GitHub and through Zenodo, available at https://bit.ly/CodePubGuide.

## Data and Code Availability:
### Chapter 2
Oxygen isotope samples used in this analysis are available from the National Centers for
Environmental Information (NCEI) Paleo Data server (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/) and
the University of São Paolo Institute of Geosciences. GPCP Precipitation data were obtained
from NOAA NCEI at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn-daily-description. NOAA OLR and
ERSST_V3b data are available from the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSL, Boulder, Colorado, USA,
from their website at https://psl.noaa.gov/. Python code to reproduce the analysis and figures and
proxy-derived PCs are available through the Zenodo open repository:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6949234. (Orrison, 2022).

## Chapter 3
Paleoclimate records from PIM4 and JAR4 are available at the PANGEA data server:
https://www.pangaea.de/. Paleoclimate records from Pumacocha, P00-H1, DV2+TR5+LD12 and
Quelccaya are available at the NOAA Paleo Data website:
https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/. Paleoclimate records from Cuy and Bol are
available at https://zenodo.org/record/7105508 and the UTU record is available at
https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleosearch/study/39171. The SBE3 and JAR4 records can be
177found in the supplementary information of Novello et al. (2018). The MFZ-N-1 paleoclimate
record is available pending publication of that dataset or upon request. The Hadley-OI SST data
can be accessed at: https://gdex.ucar.edu/dataset/158_asphilli.html. GNIP isotope and
precipitation data are available at https://nucleus.iaea.org/wiser. GPCC monthly 0.5 ° data is
available at: https://www.dwd.de/EN/ourservices/gpcc/gpcc.html. For this study, Global
Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) data were provided by the NOAA PSL, Boulder,
Colorado, USA, from their website at https://psl.noaa.gov. The AMO index (10-yr lowpass) time
series derived from the HadISST1 is available at: https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-
data/atlantic-multi-decadal-oscillation-amo. All analysis and figures were generated using
Python. The code is available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11212407 (Orrison, 2024).

## Chapter 4
Model simulations from iCESM used for this study are available with permission from K.
Heyblom and H. Singh and will become publicly available once published. Oxygen isotope
paleoclimate records are available from the NOAA Paleoclimate Archive at:
https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/. Code used to decompose the wind field into
divergent and non-divergent components to derive indices of the regional Hadley circulation is
available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388373.
