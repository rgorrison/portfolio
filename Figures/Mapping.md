## Figure purpose
The purpose of this figure is to concisely illustrate multiple layers of information. This map shows the locations of two database of paleoclimate records, one dataset used to assess variability of a multidecadal index of Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures (the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, or IPO) and the other of an interannual index of Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures (the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO). The databases contain records from diverse sources (cave, tree cores, ice cores, and lakes) which are highlighted on the map. Also indicated on this map is the background climate state to serve as a reference for extensive analysis of the information contained within each database.
