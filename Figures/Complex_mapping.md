## Figure purpose
The purpose of this figure is to concisely illustrate multiple layers of information, and it does so using *accesible* color schemes and careful key selection. This map shows the locations of two databases of paleoclimate records: one dataset used to assess variability of a multidecadal index of Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures (the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, or IPO) and the other for analysis of an interannual index of Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures (the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO). The databases contain records from diverse sources (speleothems (caves), ice cores, lakes, tree-cores, and observational stations from the IAEA network) which are highlighted on the map. Also indicated on this map is the background climate state to serve as a reference for extensive analysis of the information contained within each database describing rainfall, wind patterns, and the location of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ).
