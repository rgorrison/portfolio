## Figure purpose

The goal of this set of figures was to illustrate the geographic dispersion of paleoclimate records for the Holocene (approximately 15,000 years before present until today) to strategize about how to approach a new collaborative study. This early figure was not intended for publication, but rather to enable and propel a brainstorming disucssion. 

These simple maps show a diverse network of sites from which paleoclimate records have been generated. This figure uses two layers: first, distinct symbols illustrate the source from which information is derived (bogs, speleothems (caves), corals, ice cores, lake cores, salt flats, and ocean cores); and second, the time period available for each record is illustrated using black (for long records) and green (for shorter records).

The close-up figure on the right hand side helps to parse the region of the Southwest Atlantic where there is a high density of records available.  

## Database cleaning

show how the proxies, observations, etc, get pulled into lists? make sure this is different than proxy locs. 

## Plotting

show the plotting code?  make sure different than proxy locs.
