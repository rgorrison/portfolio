# Generating multi-layered maps to crystalize a complicated spatial story

Here I will illustrate two examples of multi-layered spatial storytelling. These images provide context for scientific investigations that seek to understand how networks of paleoclimate records document variability of key variables within an averaged background climate state including rainfall, wind patterns, and key dynamic features of the landscape. Presenting these multi-factored entities together well as a comprehensive visual is critical to setting the stage for further analysis.  

These figures concisely illustrate multiple layers of information, doing so using *color-blind accesible* color schemes and careful key selection.

## Figure purpose
This map shows the locations of two databases of paleoclimate records: one dataset used to assess variability of a multidecadal index of Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures (the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, or IPO) and the other for analysis of an interannual index of Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures (the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO). The databases contain records from diverse sources (speleothems (caves), ice cores, lakes, tree-cores, and observational stations from the IAEA network) which are highlighted on the map. Also indicated on this map is the background climate state to serve as a reference for extensive analysis of the information contained within each database describing rainfall, wind patterns, and the location of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ).

# 2: Adding close-ups for information-dense regions

## Figure purpose
This map shows the locations of multiple types of paleoclimate records (speleothems (cave records) and pollen), zooming in to rescale a section of the map that has a tight clustering of records. Also shown in this map is the background climate state, including rainfall and wind patterns.
