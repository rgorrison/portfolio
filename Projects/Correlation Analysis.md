# Calculating the relationship between Pacific Ocean variabiity and South American rainfall with correlation analysis

![Correlations between Pacific modes and precipitation](/assets/pacific_precip_corr.png)

## Figure purpose
This figure explains which regions of South America that are most influenced by changes in sea surface temperature happening remotely in the Pacific Ocean from both model generated data and from observations measured by rain gauges, and highlights the regions with statistically signficant relationships between the Pacific Ocean and South American rainfall. 

More specifically, this figure highlights the correlations between sea surface temperature time series indices and precipitation derived from modeled data for both a low-frequency mode of variability, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), and a high-frequency mode of variability, the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation, ENSO. The shading depicts spatial correlation values between seasonal rainfall amount at any point and the index. Statistically significant correlations are indicated by black stippling. The point values overlaid on the maps indicate correlations with precipitation from weather stations. Significant correlations with precipitation gauge data are indicated with a cross. In all cases, statistical significance is at the p < 0.05 level. The black square highlights a region where data were averaged to create a precipitation index.
