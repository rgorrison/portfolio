# An ensemble approach to extracting shared variability from a database

## Analysis overview
The goal of this project was to design a piece of software arrive at an understanding of dominant modes of variability of the South American Summer Monsoon. This was done using a principle component analysis to isolate the variability shared by a database of discrete records and construct a new set of maps and time series to illustrate the common patterns (spatial and temporal). 

The records used for this analysis were cave features called speleothems that contain information about the past hydrology via a proxy variable for rain: oxygen isotopes captured in calcite ($CaCO_3$). Samples of this proxy along the central axis of a speleothem provide a *floating* time series but which does not contain any temporal information. The dates, called age ties, that *anchor* the oxygen isotope time series to a fixed period in the past is generated using the radio isotopes U/Th, measured at finite points along the axis of a speleothem.  

The challenge addressed here is that each U/Th measurement has some uncertainty. In order to understand how different oxygen isotope time series compare to one another, it is important to include the uncertainty of the age ties in the principle component analysis. This was done by writing a piece of software to model the ages of oxygen isotope time series using a [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) approach. Below, the stages of this analysis are illustrated:

### 1. Select appropriate isotopic records and identify age tie uncertainty
Data curation in the initial stages is critical. Each paleoclimate record or record composite used in the analysis must be approximately complete in the study period. Each record has age ties with a reported age value and an age uncertainty of two standard deviation. 

### 2. Resample uncertainty to generate ensemble(s) of age models
For each age tie, a Gaussian distribution is assigned to within a single standard deviation from the mean and resampled 1,000 times corresponding to the Monte Carlo Method, resulting in an ensemble of 1,000 time series members for each paleoclimate record. 

### 3. Interpolate isotopic time series samples to generate record ensembles
The oxygen isotope time series for each record is interpolated to each of the time series ensembles generated by the Monte Carlo resampling, resulting in an ensemble of 1,000 isotopic time series members.

Ultimately, this results in 1,000 networks of paleoclimate records from which the principle components of shared variability are extracted. Below are selection of the model code. The full code can be found at this [Zenodo archive](https://zenodo.org/records/6949234).

## Plotting results 
The below figure captures the two dominant modes of variability. These maps and time series illustrate the shared patterns (spatial and temporal) of the databse of paleoclimate records, accounting for time uncertainty in their original measurements.
