### This folder contains projects I have done which highlight my statistical analysis, data visualization skills, and coding skills.

1) **Complex Mapping** highlights two examples of maps that layer information to tell a detailed, multi-dimensional story.
2) **Correlation Analysis** shows the spatial relationships between to systems that are separated: Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures and South American rainfall.
3) **Interactive Mapping** is a curated map for a weekend event created with Google My Maps.
4) **Regression Analysis** assess the degree of explained variance between the latitude and strength of an index of regional atmospheric circulation.
5) **Running Correlation Analysis** tells the story of what dynamics controls are most important in South American Monsoon variability.
6) **Simple Map** is an example of preliminary spatial analysis.
7) **Software** is a published open-source code example to model age chronologies of cave records.
8) **Trend Analysis** evaluates the time-evoluation of regional atmospheric circulation.
